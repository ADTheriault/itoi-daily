      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.1101.com/home/2025/images/home/darling.png" alt="Itoi signature" style="max-width: 100px; margin-bottom: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shigesato Itoi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;・The other day, for our ongoing "aging and death" series at Hobo Nikkan Itoi Shinbun, I had a conversation with Nurse Asami, who just published a book called *Let's Think About How to End Our Lives*, and with Hatano Hiroshi. I'll leave the full content for when it's published on our site, but something that Asami—a working nurse—said so casually has really stuck with me. "When people die, it's not really like in movies or TV shows, you know—lying peacefully in bed surrounded by family, quietly slipping away." Coming from a nurse who has witnessed this countless times, her words carry real weight.

The conversation continued from there, but it's so true—those familiar scenes we think we know are just memories from things we've seen before. What we generally imagine "must be how it goes" is mostly what we've absorbed from movies and television. When I was a kid, American family sitcoms were popular, and I loved watching them. But I absolutely hated it when some drunk old man would stumble up to the TV screen and slur, "Families like that don't exist anywhere! It's all lies!" Later, as an adult, I heard Yoshimoto Takaaki say essentially the same thing over and over: "Problem-free families don't exist anywhere." Now that I'm grown up, I get it. Every person has a past, present, and future—vertical, horizontal, diagonal dimensions, things near and far. The ways people connect to each other are equally complex. Something perfectly round and smoothly happy is just pie in the sky. A "picture-perfect family"—we can't help but imagine such a thing, but of course nothing like that exists in reality. It's all scars, cracks, breaks, worn spots, patches. That's just how it is, and we carry on naturally with all of that. Though of course we still enjoy our dramas as dramas.

Thank you for coming to Hobo Nikkan today. There are also healthy days spent complaining about this ache and that itch.</description>
