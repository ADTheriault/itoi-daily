    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.1101.com/home/2025/images/home/darling.png" alt="Hobonichi Darling" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read something written by a friend about her mother's passing. It was written not long after it happened, and the words still seemed to carry body warmth—it made me cry a little. To me, this might be someone else's story, but there was something precious between mother and child right there on the page, and while it was sad, I found myself feeling envious too. A little earlier that day, I'd been talking with another friend who told me that among boys who've done various "bad things," the ones who have memories of being loved by at least one person tend to bounce back more easily. Usually, she said, that person is their mother. Even hearing about this made me think "how nice" with a touch of envy. It might seem strange for a full-grown adult—an old man, even—but nothing makes me happier than watching mothers and children getting along well together. I love watching my daughter with her daughter too. I used to look at my boss and his mother with that same kind of longing. I think it's because I never had that relationship with my own mother, and for so long I practiced being "fine" with that absence. But as I've gotten older, maybe I've become more honest—I can now genuinely think how wonderful it must be to "have a mother who loves you unconditionally." A child being held tight by their mother, acting spoiled—is there anything more blissful than that? I don't have a single memory like that in my entire life. Not that I want anyone to feel sorry for me—I just want to tell myself "you did well." That's all I need, just me saying it. Mothers, children, those who love and are loved—these are truly precious "treasures," I want to say. Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. I'm going to send this without reading it over. Otherwise I'll delete it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>A man reflects on his lifelong envy of loving mother-child relationships after never experiencing unconditional maternal love himself, finding both sadness and appreciation in witnessing the precious bonds he missed. Despite this absence, he seeks only to tell himself "you did well" rather than seeking pity from others.</summary>
