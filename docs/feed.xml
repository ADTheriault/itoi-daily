      <description>**Today's Darling - January 28, 2026**

The other day, as part of our ongoing "Aging and Death" series that we do irregularly at Hobo Nikkan [translator's note: Itoi's website "Almost Daily"], I had a conversation with Nurse Asami, who just published a book called "Let's Think About How to End Our Lives," and Hatano Hiroshi. I'll leave the details for when the conversation gets published on Hobo Nikkan, but something that Asami-san, a working nurse, casually mentioned really stuck with me. "When people die, it's not really like in movies or TV dramas—you know, lying peacefully in bed surrounded by family, quietly passing away." When a nurse who has witnessed this countless times says something like that, it has real weight to it.

The conversation continued from there, but yes, that's exactly right—those "typical" scenes get stored in our memory as things we've seen before. What we generally imagine "this is probably how it goes" is actually stuff we've picked up from movies and TV productions. When I was a kid, American family sitcoms were popular, and I really enjoyed watching them. But I absolutely hated it when some drunk old man would start yelling at the TV screen, "Families like that don't exist! It's all lies!" Later, as an adult, I heard almost the exact same thing from Yoshimoto Takaaki [translator's note: influential Japanese poet and critic] many times. He would declare with certainty, "Families without any problems don't exist anywhere."

Well, now that I'm an adult, I get it. Every single person has a past, present, and future—vertical, horizontal, diagonal dimensions, things near and far. The relationships between people are also all kinds of complicated. Something perfectly round and smoothly happy is just a pie in the sky. We tend to picture an "ideal family," but of course, no such thing exists in reality. It's all scratches, cracks, breaks, worn spots, patches—that kind of stuff everywhere. And that's perfectly natural—we just keep going with all of that. Though of course, I still enjoy dramas as dramas.

Thank you for coming to Hobo Nikkan again today. There are also those days of good health spent complaining about aches and pains.

Hobo Nikkan's update time is now 11 AM every day, including weekends and holidays.

      <description>・The other day, I spoke with Nurse Asami—who just published a book called *Let's Think About How to End Our Lives*—and Hatano Hiroshi as part of an ongoing, sporadic series we do at Hobonichi on "aging and death." I'll leave the details for when it's published on Hobonichi for you to read, but something that practicing nurse Asami said so casually has really stuck with me. "When people die, it's not really like in movies or TV dramas—you know, lying peacefully in bed surrounded by family, going quietly." When a nurse who has witnessed this countless times says something like that, it carries real weight.

The conversation continued from there, but yes, exactly—those familiar scenes get lodged in our memory as something we've seen before. What we generally imagine "it's probably like this" is largely based on what we've encountered through movies and television. When I was a kid, American family sitcoms were popular, and I'd be happily watching them when some drunk old man would start yelling at the screen: "Families like that don't exist! It's all bullshit!" I really hated that. Later, as an adult, I heard something remarkably similar from Yoshimoto Takaaki over and over: "There's no such thing as a family without problems anywhere," he'd declare. Now that I'm grown up, I understand. Every single person has a past, present, and future—vertical, horizontal, diagonal dimensions, things near and far. The ways people connect to each other are equally varied. Something perfectly round and smoothly happy is a pie in the sky. We tend to imagine these "picture-perfect families," but of course no such thing exists in reality. It's all scratches, cracks, breaks, worn spots, patches. And getting by with all of that is the natural way of things. Though of course we still enjoy dramas as dramas.

Thank you for coming to Hobonichi today. There are also days of complaining about aches and pains while being perfectly healthy.</description>
