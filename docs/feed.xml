It was written not long after it happened, and the words still seemed to carry body heat—it made me cry a little. To me, she might be a stranger, but there was something precious between mother and child right there on the page, and though it was sad, I found myself feeling envious too. A little earlier that day, I'd been talking with another friend who told me that among boys who've done various "bad things," the ones who have memories of being loved by even just one person tend to bounce back more easily. Usually, he said, that person is their mother. Even hearing about that made me think "how nice" with a touch of envy. It might seem strange for a grown man—an old man, even—but there's nothing I love more than watching mothers and children getting along well together. I look at my daughter and her daughter and think how wonderful it is. I used to look at my boss at home and his mother with that same kind of longing. I think it's because I never had that relationship with my own mother, so for a long time I practiced being "fine" with not having it. But as I've gotten older, maybe I've become more honest—I can now openly think how good it must be to "have a mother who loves you unconditionally." A child being held tight by their mother, acting spoiled—could there be anything more blissful than that? I don't have a single memory like that in my entire life. No, no—I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I just want to give myself a little "you did well" pat on the back. If I'm the only one saying it to me, that's enough. Mothers, children, those who love and are loved—I want to tell them that what they have is a magnificent "treasure." Thank you for coming to Hobonichi again today. For some reason, I'm going to hit send today without reading this over. Otherwise I'll just delete it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary>The author reflects on his lifelong envy of mother-child relationships he never experienced, finding both sadness and appreciation in witnessing the unconditional love between mothers and their children. Despite lacking such memories himself, he acknowledges this as a "magnificent treasure" and gently encourages himself that surviving without it was an accomplishment worth recognizing.</summary>
